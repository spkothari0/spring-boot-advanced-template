This Branch contains Authentication, authorization, Role-based authorization, Spring Security, Swagger (Controller name Customization i.e. instead of "student-controller", it will show as "Student" on the Swagger IU), and JWT integration.

The users are created here using UserDetailsService. This will be removed in the coming versions and will be updated in the other branch.
