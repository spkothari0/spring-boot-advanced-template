# Advanced Spring Boot Template Application
This project is a comprehensive Spring Boot template designed to serve as a robust foundation for any Spring Boot-based application. It incorporates industry-standard configurations and features, providing a scalable, secure, and high-performance starting point.

## Features
### 1. Security and Authentication
- **JWT Authentication:** Implemented Spring Security using JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Configured roles and access controls for different API endpoints.
- **CSRF Protection:** Enabled for stateful web applications (e.g., forms). Disabled for stateless REST APIs secured with JWT tokens, where CSRF protection is not necessary.

### 2. API Documentation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Configured Swagger for API documentation to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing APIs.

### 3. Database Integration
- **JPA/Hibernate:** Set up JPA for ORM and database interaction to ensure smooth data persistence.

### 4. Exception Handling
- **Global Exception Handling:** Centralized exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice`, allowing for consistent error responses across the application.

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- **Spring Boot Actuator:** Integrated Actuator to monitor the applicationâ€™s health and performance metrics.
- **SLF4J with Log4j2:** Configured for advanced logging capabilities, providing detailed logs for easier debugging and analysis.

### 6. Configuration Management
- **External Configuration:** Managed externalized configurations using application.properties and application.yml for flexible environment-specific settings.
- **Profiles:** Configured environment-specific profiles (dev, test, and prod) to handle different runtime configurations.

### 7. Asynchronous Processing
- **Spring Async:** Implemented asynchronous task execution using `@Async` to improve performance and scalability where applicable.
- **Scheduling:** Enabled scheduled task execution using `@Scheduled` for periodic jobs.

### 8. Caching
- **Spring Cache:** Integrated Spring Cache abstraction to enhance performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Cache Providers:** Configured with cache providers like Ehcache or Redis for optimized caching solutions.

### 9. File Handling
- **AWS S3 Integration:** Integrated AWS S3 for storing and retrieving profile pictures, ensuring reliable and scalable file storage.

### 10. Email Integration
- **Spring Email:** Configured email sending using Spring Email to facilitate user notifications, such as account activation and password reset emails.
- 
### 11. WebSocket Support
- **Spring WebSocket:** Implemented real-time communication using WebSockets. Though not utilized in the current project, the WebSocket configuration is ready for future extensions.

### 12. Correlation ID
- **Correlation ID Header:** Added correlation IDs to all API headers to track requests across services and ensure better traceability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- AWS credentials for S3 integration
- SMTP server for email integration

### Installation
- 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/advanced-spring-boot-template.git
cd advanced-spring-boot-template
```

- 2. Configure the application properties: Update the application.properties or application.yml with your environment-specific settings, including database connections, S3 credentials, and email server configurations.

- 3. Build and run the application:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
